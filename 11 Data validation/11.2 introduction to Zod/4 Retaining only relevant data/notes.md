**Retaining only relevant data** is a critical feature for validation libraries like Zod, as it ensures that the data passed to your application is both **secure** and **predictable**. Here’s why this matters and why Zod supports this functionality:

---

### 1. **Improved Security**
- **Prevent Injection Attacks**: Extraneous or unexpected fields in an object might open the door to injection attacks or other vulnerabilities. For example, malicious users might add fields to influence your application's behavior.
- Zod's **strict object schemas** (`.strict()`) strip out any unexpected fields or reject the object entirely, ensuring only validated data is processed.

---

### 2. **Predictable Data Shape**
- **Avoid Bugs**: If your code assumes certain fields exist or doesn’t handle extra fields properly, unexpected behavior or errors might occur.
- By ensuring that only relevant fields remain after validation, Zod provides a **predictable, consistent data shape**, making the data easier to work with.

---

### 3. **Simplified Logic**
- **Reduce Post-Validation Cleanup**: Without strict validation, you might need to manually filter or clean up the input data after validation. Zod can handle this step for you, making your code cleaner and more focused on business logic.

---

### 4. **Compliance with APIs**
- Many APIs and services expect data to match a specific schema. Sending extraneous data can result in errors or undefined behavior. Zod can enforce such restrictions automatically.

### How Zod Handles This
Zod provides several mechanisms to ensure only relevant data is retained:

1. **Strict Object Validation**:
   - Use `.strict()` to enforce that no extra fields are allowed in the object.
     ```javascript
     const schema = z.object({
       name: z.string(),
       age: z.number(),
     }).strict();

     schema.parse({ name: "Alice", age: 30, extra: "value" }); // ❌ Throws an error
     ```

2. **Transformations**:
   - Use `.transform()` to map or clean up data after validation.
     ```javascript
     const schema = z.object({
       name: z.string(),
       age: z.number(),
     }).transform((data) => {
       return { ...data, isAdult: data.age >= 18 };
     });

     console.log(schema.parse({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })); // ✅ { name: "Alice", age: 30, isAdult: true }
     ```

3. **Partial or Stripped Schemas**:
   - Use `.pick()` or `.omit()` to retain only the necessary fields when working with subsets of data.
     ```javascript
     const fullSchema = z.object({
       name: z.string(),
       age: z.number(),
       role: z.string(),
     });

     const partialSchema = fullSchema.pick({ name: true, age: true });
     console.log(partialSchema.parse({ name: "Alice", age: 30, role: "admin" })); // ✅ { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
     ```

### Why Should Zod Do This?
Zod is often used in contexts like API validation, form validation, and database input sanitization, where controlling the shape of the data is essential for:
- **Security**
- **Error Prevention**
- **Performance Optimization**
- **Interoperability with Other Tools**

By retaining only relevant data, Zod helps developers focus on core logic without worrying about unexpected or malicious input. This makes it a vital feature for reliable and robust application development.
