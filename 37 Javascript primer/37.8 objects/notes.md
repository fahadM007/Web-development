# Learning objectives

* You know what objects are and how to create them.
* You know how to set and retrieve values in objects.
* You know how to iterate over data in an object.
* You know what JSON is and know how to transform an object into a JSON string and a JSON string into an object.

## defining an object 

* objects use keys what is an object are variables that can contain many values each with a specific label (key)
* objects use string as keys 
* accessing the data also differs between object and maps 

## Object literal  notation of object definition 

const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
};

## accessing value is done in two ways 

properties or methods when value is a function 

bracket notation when there is space in the name 
dot notation 

## Adding a property


can be done using an assignment operator and an accessor 

so the dot and bracket notation is an accessor 

# Iterating over properties

Object.entries = do what 

it return an array of arrays where each inner arrays represents a key value pair from the person object 

# JSON and objects


is a format that is used for passing javascript objects in textual fromat 

keys are also with quotes and presented as strings
