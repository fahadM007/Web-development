# Working with Multiple Files

* js can export and import value and functions 

* The help import and export values and functions in in use in other files. 

two ways to export a file in js 

* nameed export 
* default export 

the difference is that module file can have only one default export and have many name export 

# Default export and import

fun.js contains greeting 

importing a default value is done by using an import statement 

statment is a syntactic unit that express some action to be carried out 

# Named exports

we use destructuring and wer can export multiple functions 

# Importing all functions with a namespace

what is a namespace in programming 

a name space provide a container yo hold things like functions classes and constants as a way to group them togther logically adn help avoid conflicts with functions and classes with the same name 

In the broadest definition namespaces are a way of encapsulating items.

# Working with a variable defined in a separate file

the value can only be acces through the function 
and it will only have one instance even if it is imported twice 


# Files in folders
