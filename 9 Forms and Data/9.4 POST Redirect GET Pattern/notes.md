You know how to use the POST/Redirect/GET pattern in web applications.

When we study our applications with forms, we observe behavior that is likely not wanted. When we send data to the server and refresh the page using the f5-button (or the refresh button), we notice that the browser wants to send the data to the server again. This is due to the refresh button re-implementing the previously made request. Such behavior is, in general, not wanted

the design pattern called post/redirect/get pattern
