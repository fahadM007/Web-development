# Defining and Submitting Forms

Learning objectives
You understand how forms work and can create forms using HTML.
You can read submitted form data on the server.

HTML forms
HTML Forms are used for entering data and sending data to the server. Forms are created using the HTML form-element. Each form can contain from zero to a nearly unlimited amount of form fields. Each field is represented with a separate element.

  ## Form element

* Its has two attributes `method` and `action`. 
* The method describes the used http method its either POST or GET 
* while the action describes the path to which the data is sent. 
* by default `GET` 
* by default  if the action attribute is missing, the current address and path is used by default.


```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello forms!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form method="POST" action="/addresses">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

## A form with one input field

we use the `input` element to create input 
The input element has number of attributes 

* `type` this describes the type of input filed 
*  `id`  This attribute is used for referring to the input field from the  elements this provides a uniques identifer
allowing it to be referenced or targeted by other elements or code

```HTML 
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">
```

* `name` used to identifying the input fields 

The statement means that the name attribute in an HTML <input> element is used to identify the input field when the form is submitted, allowing the server to recognize and process the data entered into that input field.

When a form is submitted, the browser sends the form data as key-value pairs. The name attribute is used as the key in this pair, while the value is the data entered by the user in the corresponding input field.


## Forms labels

The `label` element is used for referring to an input field with in the form and adding textual description for the input field.

The for attribute of the <label> element links the label to a specific input field, providing a reference.

The for attribute of the <label> element links the label to a specific input field, providing a reference.

```HTML
<form>
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
  
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password">
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

```
