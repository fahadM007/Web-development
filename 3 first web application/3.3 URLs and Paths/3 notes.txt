You know what request methods are and can handle requests with different request methods.

the paramter in the funtions is the represents the http request sent to the server 

contains details of all the HTTP request such as:

The URL they are requesting (e.g., /, /about, /api).
The method of the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Any headers that are included (e.g., content type, user agent).
Body content (if there is any, like in a POST request).


Using the template code given as a part of the assignment, create an application that responds to requests made to the server as follows. Whenever a request is made to the server, the response must consist of the message 'You made a request with method ${method}', where ${method} corresponds to the request method that was used. For example, if the request is made with the 'GET' request method, e.g. by simply browsing to 'http://localhost:8000', the server must respond with the message 'You made a request with method GET'. Similarly, if the request method is 'POST', then the response must be 'You made a request with method POST'. When completed, test the application locally and return it here.
